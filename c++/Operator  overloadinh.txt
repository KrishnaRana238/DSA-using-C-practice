Its a special feature in c++ that allow you to treat user defines data type just type built in data type is called operator overloadig
Rules to operator overloading
1. only existing operator can be overloaded, view operator can not be  created
2. The overloaded operator must have atleast 1 class type operand
3. We cannot change the basic memory of a operator.  i.e'f' will be subtraction
4. Syntax rule for overloaded operator will remain same i.e 'f' will be need 3 operands only  

2 Method to implement

using membership txn "Operator"
using friend function 


type of operator
1  Uninary Opertor
!  using membership function"operator"(no argument is required)
!  using friend function(requires 1 argument of class type)

2 Binary Operator
! using m function operator(1 argument is requires not neccesarily class type)
!
